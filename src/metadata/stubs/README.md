## Description:

The `stubs` module contains files describing some features of the V language that are not explicitly
described in the standard library.

For example, some compile-time functions or attributes.

> **Note**
> This is not real code, it is only needed for Doki and IDE to be able to show documentation and
> jump to definitions.
